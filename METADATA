  "From the homepage:  'Performance-oriented Congestion Control (PCC) is a "
  "new architecture that achieves consistent high performance even under "
  "challenging conditions. PCC senders continuously observe the connection "
  "between their actions and empirically experienced performance, enabling "
  "them to consistently adopt actions that result in high performance.' "
  "This particular implementation of the PCC algorithm is compatible "
  "with the chromium QUIC implementation."
